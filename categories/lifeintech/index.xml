      <title>An Intro To Types In Go Part 1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before Go, I had primarily programmed in JavaScript and Python which had the fun distinction of being dynamically typed languages. When I moved to Go, I hit two specific roadblocks: 1) not fully understanding the difference between dynamic vs static languages and 2) and honestly, why should I be concerned about the difference? So naturally, I decided to create a blog post about static vs dynamic languages, and what that means for Go newbies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>151 Days Of Code</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like many, I started off 2017 with the #100DaysOfCode challenge. For the uninitiated, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.100daysofcode.com/&#34;&gt;100DaysOfCode&lt;/a&gt; challengen involves coding a minimum of an hour each day, and tweeting your progress about what you&amp;rsquo;ve been working on and accomplished. While the focus of the challenge is to work on projects everyday, a mix of projecs and tutorials are still sufficient if you need some input before starting your next challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ten Minutes Of Go</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably no secret by now that I am a big fan of Go (also known as Golang), an open source programming language that is known for its speed and efficiency. As we move towards &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.golang.org/toward-go2&#34;&gt;Go 2&lt;/a&gt; and the eventual nuances and challenges that will come with its newest iteration, I want to take a few minutes to talk about what I think makes Go so special.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lessons in Programming: Giving Yourself Credit</title>
      <link>https://zentechnista.github.io/2017/07/lessons-in-programming-giving-yourself-credit/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s note: This post was originally titled &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re awesome and should feel awesome&amp;rdquo;, but I realized that might be a bit of a mouthful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For nearly all people who are learning to code on a non-traditional path (self study, bootcamps, etc.) it&amp;rsquo;s easy to experience feelings of doubt and discouragement. Not only can it be difficult going through the basics - picking a language, finding a good resource, and sticking to it without the structure of more traditional learning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lessons in Programming: Learning To Get Uncomfortable</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Learning to get uncomfortable.&amp;rdquo; Kind of a weird article topic for a blog post right? There&amp;rsquo;s tons of articles on FOMO (Fear of Missing Out for the uninitiated), ignoring FOMO, sticking on the path of mastery, never giving up, knowing how to give up, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sprints, Marathons, and Code</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Roughly about 3 months ago to the day, I made an exciting decision to leave my previous job to join an e-commerce and social analytics startup. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a particularly difficult decision - I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure wanting to hide under a rock ever Monday morning is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a great sign that you&amp;rsquo;re enjoying your current position - but still, it represented a level of change that was both fun and intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;
