      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s note: This post was originally titled &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re awesome and should feel awesome&amp;rdquo;, but I realized that might be a bit of a mouthful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For nearly all people who are learning to code on a non-traditional path (self study, bootcamps, etc.) it&amp;rsquo;s easy to experience feelings of doubt and discouragement. Not only can it be difficult going through the basics - picking a language, finding a good resource, and sticking to it without the structure of more traditional learning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Learning to get uncomfortable.&amp;rdquo; Kind of a weird article topic for a blog post right? There&amp;rsquo;s tons of articles on FOMO (Fear of Missing Out for the uninitiated), ignoring FOMO, sticking on the path of mastery, never giving up, knowing how to give up, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Roughly about 3 months ago to the day, I made an exciting decision to leave my previous job to join an e-commerce and social analytics startup. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a particularly difficult decision - I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure wanting to hide under a rock ever Monday morning is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a great sign that you&amp;rsquo;re enjoying your current position - but still, it represented a level of change that was both fun and intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;
